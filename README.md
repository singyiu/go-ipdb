# IPDB

Inspired by [IPLD](https://github.com/ipld/ipld) and [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs),

IPDB is a **protocol**:
- Defines a schema-addressed database system
- Coordinates database query delivery on Web3
- Designed with a public decentralized database in mind

It extends the concept of IPFS to cover decentralized database by making the schema addressable:

IPFS | IPDB
------------ | -------------
File / Data | Database Schema
Content ID | Schema ID
